# Projects
As of 5/31/2022, these are all school related projects.	
#Genetic Algorithm works by creating a random pool, performing genetic crossover by splicing genes at random and then creating new generations until a fitness score
of 20 is reached. #Machine_Learning_Clustering_Large_Data is a project where I applied PCA, Hierarchical, and K-means clustering to a large data set. The purpose was
to see the effectiveness of the three algorithms on predicting which variables were most important in predicting the target outcome. This project was done without first cleaning the data set. That will be the next project.
